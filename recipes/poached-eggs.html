    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon champagne vinegar</li>
      <li>Â½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 eggs, as fresh as possible</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill a bowl with ice water./li></li>
      <li>
        Fill a saucepan with cold water and place over medium heat; stir in
        vinegar and salt. Bring to a gentle, slow simmer and reduce heat to low.
      </li>
      <li>
        Break each egg into a separate small ramekin; place a ramekin close to
        the surface of the water and gently pour egg into the simmering water.
        Let egg white set for a minute or two and use a silicone spatula to
        gently lift egg from the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking. Cook
        until white is firm and yolk is runny, about 6 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lift poached egg from water using a slotted spoon and transfer gently to
        bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Reheat eggs for 1 1/2 to
        2 minutes in very gently simmering water and remove with a slotted
        spoon. Tap bottom of slotted spoon containing egg on a dry paper towel
        to remove any excess water before serving.
      </li>
      <li>Continue cooking until brown on both sides.</li>
    </ol>
