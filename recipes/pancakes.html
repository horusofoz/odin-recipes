    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Flour: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Baking powder: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy
        pancakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sugar: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly
        sweet pancakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making
        your pancakes taste salty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Milk and butter: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the
        pancakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Egg: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the
        pancake batter together.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
      It's not hard to make homemade pancakes â€” you just need a good recipe.
      That's where we come in! You'll find the step-by-step recipe below, but
      here's a brief overview of what you can expect.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Sift the dry ingredients together.</li>
      <li>Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine.</li>
      <li>Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle or pan.</li>
      <li>Cook for two to three minutes, then flip.</li>
      <li>Continue cooking until brown on both sides.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>When to Flip Pancakes</h3>
    <p>
      Your pancake will tell you when it's ready to flip. Wait until bubbles
      start to form on the top and the edges look dry and set. This will usually
      take about two to three minutes on each side.
